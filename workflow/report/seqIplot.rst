In sequence index plots (type="i" or type="I"), the requested individual sequences are rendered with horizontal stacked bars depicting the states over successive positions (time). Optional arguments are idxs for specifying the indexes of the sequences to be plotted (when type="i" defaults to the first ten sequences, i.e idxs=1:10). For nicely plotting a (large) whole set of sequences, use type="I" which is type="i" with idxs=0 and the additional graphical parameters border=NA and space=0 to suppress bar borders and space between bars. The sortv argument can be used to pass a vector of numerical values for sorting the sequences or to specify a sorting method. See plot.stslist for a complete list of optional arguments and their description.
