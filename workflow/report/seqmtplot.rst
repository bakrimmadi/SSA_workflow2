The mean time plot (type="mt") displays the mean time spent in each state of the alphabet as computed by the seqmeant function. The plot.stslist.meant plot method is used to plot the resulting statistics. Set serr=TRUE to display error bars on the mean time plot. Bar labels can be specified by passing the bar.labels among the ... arguments. In that case, bar.labels must be either a matrix with group specific labels in columns or a single vector to display the same labels for all groups.
