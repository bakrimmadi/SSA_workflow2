The representative sequence plot (type="r") displays a reduced, non redundant set of representative sequences extracted from the provided state sequence object and sorted according to a representativeness criterion. The seqrep function is called to extract the representative set which is then plotted by calling the plot.stslist.rep method. A distance matrix is required that is passed with the diss argument or by calling the seqdist function if diss=NULL. The criterion argument sets the representativeness criterion used to sort the sequences. Refer to the seqrep and plot.stslist.rep manual pages for a complete list of optional arguments. See Gabadinho and Ritschard (2013) for more details on the extraction of representative sets. Also look at the examples below.
